Introduction to Computer Networks course. 
Learning outcomes:
1. Describe the hardware devices used to create a network
2. Give examples of networking technologies, and examine the associated standards
3. Describe the essential features of a networking protocol
4. Describe various congestion control, error detection, and error correction schemes
5. Create a local area network and a model intranet by configuring networking hardware
and software in a controlled laboratory environment
6. Create low-level client-server application programs using the socket API
7. Demonstrate (simulate) the processes of packet construction, packet switching, and
packet deconstruction
8. Apply a route discovery algorithm to determine the shortest path in an internet
represented as a weighted graph
9. Compare/contrast cable networking and wireless networking
10. Use a variety of networking services, such as DNS, NAT, and ARP
11. Associate networking functions with the appropriate layers of the ISO/OSI network
layering model, and associate internetworking functions with the appropriate layers of the
TCP/IP layering model
12. Describe network security issues and some of the methods for managing those issues
And:
1. Explain the concept of packet-switching, and identify and analyze the different types of
packet delay in packet-switched networks
2. Describe the essential principles of a transport layer protocol including reliable data
transfer, flow control, and congestion control
3. Use IP addressing and apply routing algorithms to find shortest paths for network-layer
packet delivery
4. Describe and compare data link layer services and multiple access techniques
5. Describe network security issues and some of the methods that address them
6. Use networking tools to observe and analyze behaviors of networking protocols
